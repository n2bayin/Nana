				As social creatures, lions live in groups known as prides, which are usually made up of a few adult males, a few related 
				females, and their young ones. Their main habitats are Africa's savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands, though a tiny 
				population can also be found in India's Gir Forest. Large herbivores like antelopes, buffalo, and zebras are the main 
				prey for these carnivorous big cats. When hunting, lionesses typically assume the lead and hunt in unison to bring down 
				prey. Even though they have a reputation for being fierce, lions are threatened by poaching, habitat loss, and conflicts 
				with other wildlife, so conservation efforts are essential to their survival.
